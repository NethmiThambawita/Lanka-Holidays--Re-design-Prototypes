# Lanka-Holidays--Re-design-Prototypes

Excited to share my recent project focused on enhancing user experience for the Lanka Holidays https://lankaholidays.com/ website! ðŸŽ‰ As part of a comprehensive design process, I conducted user research to identify significant usability issues, including confusing navigation and inconsistent design elements. Utilizing tools like Figma, I created low-fidelity prototypes to explore various design solutions, followed by high-fidelity prototypes that transformed our findings into interactive, user-friendly interfaces. My contributions included designing key pages such as the Unregistered User Home Page, Registered User Home Page, Login Page, Registering User Page, User Detail Edit Page, and Receiving Successful View Page. This project has allowed me to deepen my skills in user-centered design and prototyping while working collaboratively to significantly improve the overall user experience. Looking forward to connecting with others who are passionate about UX design!
